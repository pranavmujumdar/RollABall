Unity: Roll A Ball 

This game is based on the Unity's Roll A Ball tutorial. Has following features:

1. Ball gets bigger and faster on collision with the purple surfaces

2. Ball gets smaller and slower on collision with the green surfaces

3. One life is lost when ball touches the "Spikes", and ball is re-spawned to the beginning of the game 

4. There are Teleporters that can be accessed to go to the different areas of the maze
5. Each play has 3 lives and upon losing the game restarts, same as after winning the game and collecting all the pick ups

I created this game to get a beginner's understanding of how triggers and collisions work in unity, as well as get the hang of the Assembly C# Scripting.
